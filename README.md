# 🥩 THE MEAT SHED POS 🍗

**Smart Meat Shop Management Made Simple**  

The Meat Shed POS is a modern **Point of Sale system** tailored for a local meat shop in Kenya.  
It combines a clean front-end with a simple backend powered by `json-server` to make inventory and sales management seamless.

## 🌟 What It Does
- 📦 **Inventory Management** – Track products in categories: Beef, Chicken, Pork, Bacon, and Sausages.  
- 🛒 **Sales System** – Add products to cart, process checkout, and auto-deduct from stock.  
- 💰 **Balance Updates** – Inventory and sales balances adjust instantly after each transaction.  
- 📊 **Sales History** – Mini reports showing each sale with remaining balance.  
- 🖼️ **Product Images** – Visual representation of products for a more engaging POS experience.  

---

## 🚀 Why It Stands Out
- Designed with **Kenyan butcheries and small shops** in mind.  
- Runs smoothly with a lightweight backend (`json-server`), making it easy to demo and extend.  
- Deployed on **Render**, so the frontend and backend live together under one roof.
